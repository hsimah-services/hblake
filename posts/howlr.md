# Howlr: Multi-Room Audio With Music Assistant and Snapcast

Howlr is the multi-room audio system for [The Loft](https://github.com/hsimah-services/the-loft). It streams music from Spotify, Plex, Apple Music, and a vinyl turntable to speakers throughout the condo using Music Assistant and Snapcast. The name comes from pomskies howling - this one streams audio to every room.

## Why Not Just Buy a Sonos

The obvious alternative to building a multi-room audio system is buying one. Sonos, Apple HomePod, or Amazon Echo speakers all do multi-room audio out of the box. Here's why I didn't go that route:

- **Source lock-in**: Sonos and HomePod each have preferred ecosystems. I wanted to stream from any source - Spotify, Apple Music, Plex, and a turntable - to any room, from a single interface.
- **Cost**: Good Sonos speakers for three rooms costs over $1,000. Two Raspberry Pis with decent powered monitors cost under $200 total, and they're general-purpose computers that also run other services.
- **Control**: I can add sources, rooms, and automation without waiting for a vendor to add a feature. When I added the vinyl turntable, it was a URL change in Music Assistant - no firmware update required.

The trade-off: setup complexity is significantly higher than plugging in a Sonos. And the mobile app experience isn't as polished - Music Assistant's web UI works well but it's not a native app.

## Architecture

Howlr uses Docker Compose profiles to run different containers on different hosts from the same compose file:

```yaml
services:
  # Server profile - runs on space-needle
  music-assistant:
    image: ghcr.io/music-assistant/server:latest
    container_name: howlr
    profiles:
      - server
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - /opt/howlr:/data

  # Client profile - runs on viking and fjord
  snapclient:
    image: ivdata/snapclient:latest
    container_name: howlr-snapclient
    profiles:
      - client
    network_mode: host
    devices:
      - /dev/snd:/dev/snd
    environment:
      HOST: ${SNAPSERVER_HOST}
      EXTRA_ARGS: "--soundcard ${SOUND_DEVICE:-default} --hostID ${HOST_ID}"
```

Each host's `.env` file selects which profile runs:

- `space-needle` (`COMPOSE_PROFILES=server`): Runs Music Assistant, which includes a built-in Snapcast server
- `viking` and `fjord` (`COMPOSE_PROFILES=client`): Run lightweight Snapcast clients that receive audio and play it through attached speakers

This means one compose file works for all hosts. `docker compose up -d` on `space-needle` starts the server; the same command on a Pi starts the client. The profile is controlled by a single environment variable.

## Music Assistant

[Music Assistant](https://music-assistant.io/) is the brains of the operation. It's a music library manager and multi-room audio controller that aggregates sources and distributes audio to players. Key features we use:

- **Multiple music sources**: Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Plex (our own library), and a custom Icecast URL (the turntable)
- **Built-in Snapcast server**: No separate Snapcast server container needed. MA manages player groups, volume, and sync.
- **Spotify Connect plugin**: Each room appears as a Spotify Connect target. Open Spotify on your phone, tap "Upstairs", and it plays through the Pi in that room.
- **AirPlay Receiver plugin**: Same idea for Apple devices. AirPlay to "Downstairs" and it plays through `fjord`'s speakers.

### Why Music Assistant Over Mopidy, Volumio, or Roon

- **Mopidy**: Great for single-room setups with MPD clients. Doesn't handle multi-room distribution or Spotify Connect/AirPlay natively.
- **Volumio**: Designed for dedicated audio hardware (HiFiBerry, etc.). Less flexible for fleet-style deployments across different hardware.
- **Roon**: Arguably the best multi-room audio software, but it costs $10/month and requires a Roon-specific endpoint setup. Music Assistant is free and open-source.
- **Home Assistant + Snapcast**: Music Assistant started as a Home Assistant add-on and graduated to a standalone project. You can still integrate it with HA for automation, but it runs independently.

The trade-off: Music Assistant is younger software. The Spotify Connect and AirPlay plugins are early-stage with 0.5-5 second startup latency on play/pause/skip. Ongoing playback is real-time with no degradation - it's just the initial command that's slow.

## Snapcast: Synchronized Audio

[Snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast) is the transport layer. It streams audio from the server to clients with time synchronization, so speakers in different rooms play in perfect sync. This is the same technique Sonos uses (though with a different protocol).

The server runs inside Music Assistant. Clients connect to it from `viking` and `fjord`:

```yaml
snapclient:
    image: ivdata/snapclient:latest
    network_mode: host
    devices:
      - /dev/snd:/dev/snd
    environment:
      HOST: ${SNAPSERVER_HOST}
      EXTRA_ARGS: "--soundcard ${SOUND_DEVICE:-default} --hostID ${HOST_ID}"
```

- **`/dev/snd`** passes the host's ALSA sound devices into the container. The Pis have USB DACs or 3.5mm output going to powered monitors.
- **`HOST`** points to `space-needle`'s IP where the Snapcast server runs.
- **`HOST_ID`** gives each client a stable identity for room grouping. Without this, Snapcast would assign a new random ID on every container restart, losing your group configuration.

### Why Host Networking for Audio

Both server and client use `network_mode: host`. Music Assistant needs host networking for its Spotify Connect and AirPlay plugins (they use mDNS/Bonjour for discovery, which requires being on the LAN broadcast domain). Snapclient needs it for low-latency audio - bridge networking adds measurable latency that can cause sync issues.

## The Raspberry Pi Clients

`viking` and `fjord` are Raspberry Pi 3 B+ boards. They're old hardware - the Pi 3 B+ was released in 2018 - but Snapclient is lightweight enough to run on them comfortably. Music Assistant's server requires a Pi 4+ for arm64 support, so the Pi 3s are client-only.

Each Pi has a powered speaker connected. The ALSA device is set in `.env`:

```bash
COMPOSE_PROFILES=client
SNAPSERVER_HOST=192.168.86.28
SOUND_DEVICE=default
HOST_ID=viking
```

### Pi Stability

Pis on WiFi can be flaky. The fleet has a WiFi watchdog cron job that checks if `wlan0` has lost its IPv4 address and restarts `dhcpcd` if so:

```
*/5 * * * * root ip link show wlan0 &>/dev/null && \
  ! ip -4 addr show wlan0 2>/dev/null | grep -q inet && \
  systemctl restart dhcpcd
```

This catches the common failure mode where the Pi's WiFi adapter drops its DHCP lease and doesn't renew. It's a hack, but it's kept both Pis online reliably.

## Spotify Connect Limitations

The Spotify Connect plugin in Music Assistant has one significant limitation: **only one target can be active per Spotify account at a time**. If you're streaming to "Upstairs" and someone else in the household opens Spotify and picks "Downstairs", it'll take over the session.

The workaround: a Spotify Family plan. Each family member gets their own Spotify login and can stream to different rooms simultaneously. This is a Music Assistant limitation, not a Snapcast one - Snapcast itself handles multiple simultaneous streams without issue.

## How Vinyl Fits In

The [Spinnik](/posts/spinnik) service streams the turntable as an Icecast URL (`http://calavera:8000/vinyl`). Music Assistant treats this as a radio station. Select it, pick a room (or all rooms), and the vinyl plays everywhere through the same Snapcast pipeline. No special configuration on the howlr side - just a URL.

## Trade-Offs

- **Startup latency**: Spotify Connect and AirPlay have noticeable delay on the first play/pause/skip action. It's a few seconds, not minutes, but it's jarring compared to a Sonos.
- **Pi 3 B+ limitations**: Can't run the Music Assistant server, only the client. If a Pi dies, it's replaced with the same model (cheap) or upgraded to a Pi 4 (which could run the server as a backup).
- **No mobile app**: Music Assistant has a web UI that works on mobile browsers, but there's no native iOS/Android app. The Spotify and Apple Music apps serve as the mobile interface for their respective sources.
- **WiFi reliability**: Pis on WiFi need a watchdog. Ethernet would be more reliable, but running cables through the condo wasn't practical.

## Future Work

- **Home Assistant integration** for automation - e.g., start playing music when someone arrives home, or lower volume at a certain time.
- **Replace Pi 3s with Pi 4s** for arm64 support, opening the possibility of running Music Assistant on a Pi as a backup server.
- **Dedicated USB DACs** on the Pis for better audio quality than the 3.5mm output.
